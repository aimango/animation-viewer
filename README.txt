CS 349 Assignment 5 README

Directories:
-"/A3" contains A3 code.
-"/A5" contains A5 code.
-"/xml-files" contains sample animations that can be imported into either A3 or A5.

A3 Notes:
-I used my own A3 code. 

-The changes I've made since the A3 submission date:
	-Fix bug for inserting frame.
	-I originally had export as gif, but I changed that to export as xml file, as required by assignment 5. The user can save the xml file in any directory via JFileChooser, and I automatically append ".xml" if the user did not specify a file extension or specified the wrong file extension.
	-I added an Import function. Users can only load an ".xml" file. 

-I force a minimum screen size of 400x600 (width x height).

How to Run A3:
-The makefile is located in the "A3/src" directory. 
-"make all" or "make" will compile and run the program.
-"make run" will run the compiled program.
-"make clean" will remove all .class files in the "src", "src/view", and "src/model" directories.



A5 Notes: 
-I copied over the necessary model components from my A3 (all of the playback functionality).

-As I've chosen to use action bars, I assume that only Android 3.0+ devices will run the app (as a minimum). I am targeting Android 4.1.

-The app was tested on a 1280x720 4.2.2 emulator and a 800x480 4.1.2 device. The canvas area of my Android app stretches to fill the screen. Scaling is done based on the A3 canvas size (fixed at 720x452). 

-The main activity (playback) is locked to portrait, but can be landscape or portrait in any other activity.

-The expected directory for opening xml files from the device (or emulator) is "mnt/sdcard/", so move the files from the "xml-files" subdirectory to "mnt/sdcard/". 

-To load from the app, press the "Open File" folder icon on the action bar. Then select the file to load. The file explorer filters by file extension when in the file dialog for loading. It filters by .xml extension so users do not have to see unrelated items. I do not allow the user to access subdirectories, so the xml files need to be placed in "mnt/sdcard".

-To access config settings, select the "Settings" wrench icon on the action bar. The user can change background colour and FPS here.


How to Run A5:
-Run via Eclipse. I did not include the "gen/" folder since they cause trouble with SVN, and are automatically generated by Eclipse when running the project, anyway.

Enhancements:
-Native PreferenceActivity used for Configuration screen.
-Filter by ".xml" extension in file load screens (both A3 and A5)
-Import functionality for A3
-Follow Android design guidelines (use of action bar).
-Scaling: I save my canvas resolution in the xml file when I export from the desktop app. The resolution can be restored on the Android app, and scaling is done accordingly.
