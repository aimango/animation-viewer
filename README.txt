This is an Animation viewer project for Android, built by myself (Elisa Lou). Written for a CS 349 Assignment taught at uWaterloo during the Winter 2013 term. It is an extension of my Java animation builder (desktop version) that can be viewed at https://github.com/aimango/sketch-animator

Directories:
-"/project" contains the project code.
-"/xml-files" contains sample animations that can be imported into the project.

Notes: 
-I copied over the necessary model components from my sketch-animator project (all of the playback functionality).

-As I've chosen to use action bars, I assume that only Android 3.0+ devices will run the app (as a minimum). I am targeting Android 4.1.

-The app was tested on a 1280x720 4.2.2 emulator and a 800x480 4.1.2 device. The canvas area of my Android app stretches to fill the screen. Scaling is done based on the A3 canvas size (fixed at 720x452). 

-The main activity (playback) is locked to portrait, but can be landscape or portrait in any other activity.

-The expected directory for opening xml files from the device (or emulator) is "mnt/sdcard/", so move the files from the "xml-files" subdirectory to "mnt/sdcard/". 

-To load from the app, press the "Open File" folder icon on the action bar. Then select the file to load. The file explorer filters by file extension when in the file dialog for loading. It filters by .xml extension so users do not have to see unrelated items. I do not allow the user to access subdirectories, so the xml files need to be placed in "mnt/sdcard".

-To access config settings, select the "Settings" wrench icon on the action bar. The user can change background colour and FPS here.


How to Run A5:
-Run via Eclipse. I did not include the "gen/" folder since they cause trouble with SVN, and are automatically generated by Eclipse when running the project, anyway.

Enhancements:
-Native PreferenceActivity used for Configuration screen.
-Filter by ".xml" extension in file load screens
-Follow Android design guidelines (use of action bar). Use of custom icons.
-Scaling: I save my canvas resolution in the xml file when I export from the desktop app. The resolution can be restored on the Android app, and scaling is done accordingly. 

Future:
-Port draw/erase/select/animation functionalities to Android.
